Designed and built prototype smart boots with terrain detection capabilities,
featuring crevasse and slippery surface detection, automatic night lighting,
and an SOS button for emergencies. Utilized an ESP32 microcontroller and
integrated Blynk IoT for cloud-based data transfer. Programmed the system 
using C++ in Arduino IDE, ensuring efficient functionality and real-time responsiveness.
